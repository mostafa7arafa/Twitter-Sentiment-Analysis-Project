# Sentiment Analysis Project

## üìå Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of text data using both **rule-based** and **deep learning** approaches. The goal is to classify text into positive or negative sentiments and compare the effectiveness of traditional lexicon-based methods versus machine learning and neural network models.

---

## üìÇ Dataset

* The dataset consists of labeled text samples with a `target` column indicating sentiment (0 = negative, 1 = positive).
* A `clean_text` column was created through preprocessing steps including:

  * Lowercasing
  * Removing stopwords and punctuation
  * Tokenization and lemmatization

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods

### 1. **VADER Sentiment Analysis**

* VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a rule-based model for sentiment analysis.
* It was applied directly to the raw text to generate polarity scores, later mapped to discrete sentiment labels.

**Observation**:
VADER provides a quick baseline but struggles with contextual nuances. While it identifies broad sentiment, accuracy was relatively low compared to ML/DL models.

---

### 2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

* A CNN model was built for text classification.
* Workflow:

  * Texts were tokenized and padded.
  * Embeddings were used as input to the CNN layers.
  * Binary cross-entropy was applied as the loss function.

**Results**:

* **Loss:** 0.4877
* **Accuracy:** 81.0%

**Observation**:
The CNN achieved significantly better performance than VADER, proving that deep learning models capture sentiment patterns more effectively. However, the results are still below expectations, suggesting CNN may not be the best architecture for this task.

## üìä Results Summary

| Model | Accuracy | Loss   | Notes                               |
| ----- | -------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| VADER | \~65‚Äì70% | N/A    | Fast, rule-based, weak on context   |
| CNN   | 81.0%    | 0.4877 | Better performance, but not optimal |

## üöÄ Next Steps

* Experiment with **LSTM / BiLSTM** to better capture sequential dependencies in text.
* Try **Transformer-based models** (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT) for contextual embeddings.
* Perform **hyperparameter tuning** and explore different embedding techniques.
* Consider **data augmentation** or more balanced datasets for improved generalization.

## üìå Conclusion

This project highlights the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to sentiment analysis. While **VADER** is simple and lightweight, it lacks contextual understanding. The **CNN model** improves accuracy but may not fully capture the sequential nature of language. Future work will focus on recurrent and transformer-based architectures for further performance improvements.

Would you like me to also **add runnable code snippets** (like preprocessing, VADER evaluation, and CNN training) inside the README so it becomes a ready-to-run **notebook-style README**?
